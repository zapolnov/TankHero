You will need the latest version of OS X 10.11 "El Capitan" to run the game.

Uncompress the TankHero-OSX.zip archive and run the Tank Hero application (the one with a nice tank icon).

 !!!IMPORTANT!!!
=================

I don't have a code signing certificate, so OS X will not, by default, allow you to run my game
due to security reasons.

The game itself is virus-free, you can check it using your antivirus software or online, for example on
https://virustotal.com/

To run the game, please follow instructions from this page:
