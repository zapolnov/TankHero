I have only tested WebGL version on Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Please ensure that you are running the latest version of one of those browsers.

MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER IS NOT SUPPORTED!
And Microsoft Edge has some glitches, so FireFox and Chrome are preferred.

If you get message "Unable to initialize WebGL" or "Exception thrown, see console", then, probably, 
your system or browser has some limitations. In this case try running Windows or OS X binaries.

If you use FireFox, then just uncompress TankHero-OSX.zip archive and open the index.html file
with FireFox.

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, on the other hand, do not work with locally downloaded files due to security reasons.
You will have to play online, please navigate your browser to: https://zapolnov.github.io/TankHero/Web/play.html
